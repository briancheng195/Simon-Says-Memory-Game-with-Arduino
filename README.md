# Simon-Says-Memory-Game-with-Arduino
- Developed a memory-based game with Arduino by integrating press buttons, speaker and LED components to create a programmable control system
- Design and implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) classes for microcontroller-based software development

# Objectives of Simon Says Game (Basic Features)
- Simon Says generates a random 3 digit number sequence and the LEDs act as a visualisation tool to indicate to the player about
  the sequence
- The player follows Simon Says by remembering Simon's 3 digit number sequence and follows his input by pressing the buttons
- If the player matches Simon Says, the player wins the round. If the player does not match the same 3 digit sequence as Simon,
  Simon wins the round
- Best of 3 rounds determines the winner of the match

# Objectives of Simon Says Game (Advanced Features)
- Game rules are the same as for basic features
- Integration of Buzzer as audio cues for different outcomes for each round and match
- Game difficulty increases by increasing digit sequence if the player wins the previous match
- Game difficulty decreases by decreasing digit sequence if Simon wins the previous match
- Best of 8 rounds with tiebreaker

# SampleThreeUnitSystem.h file 
- It is the setup to run the Simon Says game for a match
- Imports the libraries from the Input, Control and Output units, so as to call for the various methods to run the game

# TestThreeUnitSystem.ino file
- Launches the Simon Says Game
- The libraries, DebounceButton.h and Beginner_LED.h and SampleThreeUnitSystem.h are imported as they are used to setup the
  press buttons, LEDs and the game sequence of Simon Says respectively

# SampleInputUnit.h file 
# method pressButton(ana_LED feedbackLED[], int playerInput)
- When the user inputs each press button, the LED associated with the press button will switch on accordingly
  
# SampleOutputUnit.h file
# method displayGame(ana_LED feedbackLED[], int sequence[], int length)
- This method is created so as to provide a visualisation tool for the LEDs to be switched on according to Cue Generation,
  which is in regards to the pseudo random sequence generated from Simon Says

# method countDown()
- This method is created as a countdown timer so as to provide a duration of time for the user to get ready to learn the
  randomly generated sequence from Simon Says

# SampleControlUnit.h
# method SequenceGenerator(ana_LED feedbackLED[])
- This method is created so that Simon Says will generate a random 3-digit sequence with the digits ranging from 0 to 3 that
  Simon Says

# method void UserSays(ana_LED feedbackLED[], debounceButton test_button[])
- This method is created so as to allow the user to make his input sequence after the 3-digit random sequence has been
  generated by Simon Says, and also after the 3 second countdown

# method matchResult()
- The variables countUserScore and countSimonScore (initial values set to 0) keep count on the user and Simonâ€™s scores
  respectively, so as to tabulate the total points for each of them

# method score()
- This method is created so as to print the scores of the User and Simon, before the countdown and the start of each game.
  Whenever a new match begins, the scores reset and it is indicated before the game.
